# CST8285-Assignment1
Please refer to README.md file for project description.

This is my first assignment from my CST8285 Web Programming class.

In this assignment, I created a resume page for potential employers, and added a description of myself, with hyperlinks to other pages.

In the other pages, I have a resume page, listing past work and education experience, and in the projects page, I list notable projects I've completed
during my time at Algonquin. I added JavaScript functions to switch from previous to next projects.

In the contact page, I give employers a chance to contact me with their information to connect.
