            <section id="objective">
            My career objectives after I've completed my diploma at Algonquin College would be to find 
            employment in the private sector or government sector of the city, preferably the government sector, for stronger
            job security. If I am able to showcase my skills in a professional environment and find success in the field, I am 
            more than satisfied with doing so.
